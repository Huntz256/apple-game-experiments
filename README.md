# apple-game-experiments

Experiments related to the apple game (officially Fruit Box).
The game itself is at: https://en.gamesaien.com/game/fruit_box/

## Results

### Experiment 1
The majority of the apples on a board can be cleared without having to search through a game tree. (This result may be obvious for grandmaster apple game players.)

### Experiment 2
It appears that starting at the edges may be slightly better.
